# Simple-Linear-Regression


Overview

This project implements Linear Regression using Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent without using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. The dataset is normalized before training, and different learning rates are tested to observe their effects on the cost function.

### Dataset Description
The dataset consists of two files:

1. linearX.csv (Independent/Predictor Variable)
2. linearY.csv (Dependent/Response Variable)

These datasets are concatenated into a single DataFrame with columns X and Y (merged_dataset).
